# Restaurant Menu App

The app is developed in React Native by using Expo Snack (SDK 48). User data is stored in Expo SQLite and AsyncStorage.

## Features:

* Two onboarding screens
* Profile screen with possibility to upload a profile photo (or display user initials instead)
* Menu items on the home screen are displayed using section list, menu data is fetched from an external API
* Authentication flow depends on whether the user has completed onboarding


## Suggestions for further improvement

* Adding new features, such as possibility to open each menu item and add it to basket
* Add password authentication
* Improve the visual design and UI in general
* Add more UI animations to enhance the product's look, feel and interactivity

## Screenshots
